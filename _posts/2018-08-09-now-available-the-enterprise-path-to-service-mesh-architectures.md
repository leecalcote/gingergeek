excerpt: As someone interested in modern software design, you have likely heard of service mesh architectures in context of microservices. Service meshes introduce a new layer into modern infrastructures, offering the potential for creating robust and scalable applications and granular control over them. Is a service mesh right for you? Find out with my new book.

Service meshes introduce a new layer into modern infrastructures, offering the potential for creating robust and scalable applications and granular control over them. Is a service mesh right for you?</p>
<p>My newly published short book,&nbsp;<a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-enterprise-path/9781492041795/?utm_source=calcote"><em>The Enterprise Path to Service Mesh Architectures</em></a>, helps answer common questions on service mesh architectures through the lens of a large enterprise and addresses how to evaluate your organization’s readiness, factors to consider when building new applications and converting existing applications to best leverage a service mesh, and offers insight on deployment architectures used to get you there.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the only O&#8217;Reilly title available on the topic of service meshes, however. Before authoring&nbsp;<em>The Enterprise Path to Service Mesh Architectures</em>&nbsp;I happily provided technical review of two other excellent O’Reilly titles on the topic of service meshes: <a href="https://twitter.com/christianposta">Christian Posta</a>&#8216;s and <a href="https://twitter.com/burrsutter">Burr Sutter</a>&#8216;s <em><a href="http://blog.christianposta.com/our-book-has-been-released-introducing-istio-service-mesh-for-microservices?utm_source=calcote">Introducing Istio Service Mesh for Microservices</a></em>&nbsp;and <a href="https://twitter.com/gmiranda23">George Miranda</a>&#8216;s <em>The Service Mesh</em>. <span id="more-2079"></span>These three complement each other well, helping educate adopters and onlookers alike:</p>
<div>
<div class="" style="padding-left: 30px;"><i class="">Introducing Istio Service Mesh for Microservices</i>&nbsp;by Christian Posta and George Miranda does an excellent job of introducing Istio, specifically, and walks through examples of each of its core capabilities. Their book provides a unique perspective of Istio through ever so faintly-tinted OpenShift lens. The code samples incorporated to the book are clear and helpful in quickly ramping on Istio.</div>
<div class="" style="padding-left: 30px;"><i class="">&nbsp;</i></div>
<div class="" style="padding-left: 30px;"><i class="">The Service Mesh</i> by George Miranda is an introduction to service meshes in general and successfully avoids the natural inclination to compare specifics between popular service mesh offerings. Instead, George gives real-world examples of where and how service meshes have benefited customers. There’s clear value derived in learning from George&#8217;s experience.</div>
<div class="" style="padding-left: 30px;"><i class="">&nbsp;</i></div>
<div class="" style="padding-left: 30px;"><i class="">The Enterprise Path to&nbsp;Service Mesh Architectures</i>&nbsp;by Lee Calcote focuses on the value of service meshes, how they contrast against container orchestrators and other microservices frameworks, what shape various deployment models take, customization and integration of service meshes into existing infrastructure.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For as well as these three short books cover the space and specific technologies, much room is left for a deeper, post-Istio-1.0 book. And its exactly such a book that I and my two coauthors, <a href="https://twitter.com/baldwinmathew">Matt Baldwin</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/zackbutcher?lang=en">Zack Butcher</a>, have set forth to produce:&nbsp;<i class="">Istio: Up and Running</i>. There’s clear underlap and complement in these short books and our forthcoming title.</p>
<div>Like other titles on emergent technology, there’s risk in a short shelf-live of some of the technical content. The post-1.0 publication of <em>Istio: Up and Running</em> certainly improves the&nbsp;durability of its content. To further its usefulness (and shelf-life), we&#8217;re deemphasizing specifics of Istio&#8217;s deployment and focusing on other aspects like advanced deployment, multi-cluster, multi-tenant, best practices, case studies, etc., lacing these with code samples throughout.</div>
