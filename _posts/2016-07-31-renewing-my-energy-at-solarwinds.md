The majority of the existing, product suite is comprised of componentized, enterprise-architected, Windows-oriented network, systems, security, database management software. Many (not all) of these offerings were from one of ~18 acquisitions, with the latest ([LogicNow](https://www.logicnow.com)) in early June of this year. These acquisitions include three SaaS offerings, [Librato](http://Librato), [Papertrail](https://papertrailapp.com) and [Pingdom](https://www.pingdom.com), giving SolarWinds continuous-delivery known-how and a splash of DevOps culture.<!--more-->

SolarWinds is bimodal both in how offerings are built and delivered, but also in terms of customer environments its software manages. With Mode 1 offerings in hand, SolarWinds is well-poised and funded for new product initiatives and acquisitions moving toward Mode 2 offerings. With this in mind, I join forces at SolarWinds. I’ll highlight a few attractions to coming aboard:

  * company recently privatized, freeing itself from external (Street) pressure
  * recently refreshed set of well-experienced leadership
  * headquartered in Austin – a refreshing change for me from having led high profile initiatives from branch campuses
  * a forward-looking mindset toward new offerings; SaaS know-how embedded with the acquisitions of Librato, Papertrail and Pingdom
  * alignment with my long-standing love of empowering engineers to work smarter with great software

I anticipate a smooth acclimation to the company (given its culture) and role given that developer platforms, management and automation software have been, not the only, but a consistent theme throughout my career:

  * An extranet at [Weir Minerals](https://www.global.weir) integrating their ERP system with supply chain vendors for real-time information on materials and orders, automation of document management.
  * Moving to [Pelco](https://www.pelco.com) to lead Engineering IT, I empowered engineering groups to self-service and innovate autonomously by deploying network environments while maintaining supportable, dynamically-documented systems/networks with transparency to each environment’s configuration and service status; Designed first SNMP MIB and OID structure and introduced SNMP as a new capability across product portfolio; having created the Pelco Management Station, I moved to Cisco.
  * Focus on management software and efficient service delivery continued within [Cisco Remote Management Services](http://www.cisco.com/web/services/portfolio/operations-management/managed-service/index.html) group, where I spent much time pushing the envelope of ScienceLogic’s EM7 (e.g. [video mgmt](http://mspmentor.net/managed-services/sciencelogic-it-platform-includes-video-management-enterprise-msps), [network configuration management](http://blogs.cisco.com/ciscoit/configuration_management_whats_your_approach)) capabilities; brought in a data center automation engine to automate service delivery producing over 70 man-months of savings in its first year running.
  * Transitioning into [Cisco Cloud and Virtualization Group](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/data-center-virtualization/index.html), where I built [Cisco Intelligent Automation for Cloud](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/cloud-systems-management/intelligent-automation-cloud/tsd-products-support-series-home.html), (and teams of excellent engineers); delivered the initial Cisco [Intercloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercloud) release; founded the [Docker@Cisco](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwKKA_Ml1VXuQ05WUkJIWXlWc2s/view?usp=sharing) community.
  * Joining Seagate, to focus on hyper-converged infrastructure and SDS, I pushed forward [DMTF Redfish](http://dmtf.org/standards/redfish) ([1.0](http://dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP0266_1.0.0.pdf)), a next-generation of IPMI, and delivered the company’s [first implementation](http://blog.seagate.com/intelligent/redfish-slipstreams-ipmi-with-1-0-release/); Directed a suite of management software, spanning systems monitoring to drive analytics with failure prediction algorithms to the deployment of Seagate Call Home on container PaaS, Red Hat OpenShift (and joining the [OpenShift Commons](http://commons.openshift.org/)).

In the office of the CTO and chartered with technology strategy for the existing product lines and forward-looking ventures, I look forward to new challenges and relationships, and in doing so, reuniting and partnering with a former cohort from Cisco and Seagate. It seems acquisitions truly are SolarWinds’ forte – team acquisition in this case.
