To have Microsoft Entourage automatically load when logging into Mac OS  X, you can check the “Open at Login” option by right-clicking

Use the same tools listed above to prevent Entourage from auto starting at login (by deselecting “Open at Login” or removing Entourage from the list of applications in Login Items).

    I removed Entourage from my Account’s Login Items list. Entourage still starts on login. What gives?

Another application is the likely culprit here. Applications with calendaring or scheduling functionality such as MenuCalendarClock are known to launch Entourage every time it checks for events. Some have found that Keyboard Maestro, Quicksilver, LaunchBar, iKey or EntourageABMenu have a similar effect on Entourage.
