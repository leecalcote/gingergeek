To verify My Day has been turned off, open Login Items under Account in System Preferences.

My Day has a preference to either show its icon in the Dock or to show in the Mac OS menu bar. If you’re having difficulty getting one or the other preference to stick when changing the My Day icon location, note that your user account will need write permission to My Day’s Application folder found under /Applications/Microsoft Office 2008/Office/My Day.app/. Admin user accounts have this write permission by default. Standard user account will have read-only permission to this folder.
