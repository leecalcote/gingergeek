Like any open source project, it can be augmented with additional capabilities.

Contributing to Prometheus is no different than most other open source endeavors, which, like many projects, welcomes <a class="ext-link" href="https://prometheus.io/community/" rel="external nofollow">community contributions</a>. Let’s gain better familiarity with the process by augmenting Prometheus’ <a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager" rel="external nofollow">Alert Manager</a> with a new “history” view. The first step, naturally, is to check out the contributing guidelines for the specific repository (in this case, <a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" rel="external nofollow">Alert Manager</a>‘s).

When electing to contribute to any open source project, you’ll want to ensure that you are capable of wielding the technologies used with the project — in this case, those are Go, AngularJS, SQL, etc. <!--more-->
