In an Exchange environment when an Entourage 2004 user tries to schedule meetings with other users, availability information is retrieved using a WebDAV based query (Get /public/?Cmd=freebusy) to the Public Folder Server configured in your account settings under the advanced tab.

Entourage 2008 is able to also utilize ‘Exchange Web Services’ (available only on Exchange 2007 Server) to retrieve availability information. Public Folders are a feature of Microsoft Exchange Server that provide a way to collect, organize, and share information with others in an organization.

Having confirmed your Entourage Exchange account’s _Public Folders Server_ field matches that of your _Exchange Server_, you should now be able to see other user’s calendar availability, assuming your organization stores this free/busy time information in the public folder.

You should also be able to see resource/conference room availability. For an example of how to reserve resources, including Cisco Telepresence rooms, see [How-to Reserve a Conference Room in Entourage 2008](http://gingergeek.com/2009/06/how-to-reserve-a-conference-room-in-entourage-2008-calendar/).
