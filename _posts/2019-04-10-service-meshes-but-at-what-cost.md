<p>As you learn of the architecture and value provided by service meshes, you’re intrigued and initially impressed. Upon reflection, you, like many others think: <font style="color:grey;position:inline;">“I see the value, but what overhead does being on the mesh incur?” </font></p>

<p>Complicating the answer is the fact that there are over 10 service meshes projects to choose from. While this presentation does not take an in-depth look at the<a href="https://layer5.io/landscape"> landscape of service meshes</a>, it does introduce <a href="https://layer5.io/meshery">Meshery</a> as a utility for both benchmarking service mesh performance and provides a playground for familiarizing with the various features of different service meshes.</p>
